This is **Babbles**, a cheesy Twitter clone using React, Redux, React-Router, Axios, Redux-Promise and any other
popular React-related libraries that I could think of.

Here are the basic steps:
1. clean-up initial set-up and put files / directories where I want them
1. Add Redux and connect it to everything
1. Add React-Router
1. Make placeholders for Header and Footer
1. Create babbles feed and babble-box
1. Create 'like' ability
